  description: As metastatic cancer cells migrate away from primary tumors, they must navigate through 
  environments with complex mechanical properties and biochemical compositions. While these environments 
  are known to affect cellular fates, little is known about how DNA-damaging therapies influence the mechanics 
  of cancer cell migration through these environments. We aim to investigate both the interplay between 
  DNA damage in cancer cells and the mechano-biochemical properties of their local environments, 
  as well as the effects of these factors on cancer cell migration.
