- title: Cancer progression
  group: feature
  description: As metastatic cancer cells migrate away from primary tumors, they must navigate through 
  environments with complex mechanical properties and biochemical compositions. While these environments 
  are known to affect cellular fates, little is known about how DNA-damaging therapies influence the mechanics 
  of cancer cell migration through these environments. We aim to investigate both the interplay between 
  DNA damage in cancer cells and the mechano-biochemical properties of their local environments, 
  as well as the effects of these factors on cancer cell migration.

- title: Tumor clearance
  group: featured
  description: Cancer cell-immune cell interactions are common during cancer progression. Specifically, cancer 
  cells subjected to DNA-damaging therapies have been shown to secrete biochemical molecules in their local 
  environments that induce immune cell functions that can either suppress or enhance tumor growth. 
  However, the quantitative relationships between DNA damage in cancer cells, the properties of 
  their local environments, and immune cell recruitment to tumors remain poorly understood. We aim to understand 
  how both DNA damage in cancer cells and the mechano-biochemical properties of tumor microenvironments affect the 
  mechanics of immune cell recruitment to tumors.
