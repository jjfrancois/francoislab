Postdoctoral Research Fellow - Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School
Ph.D. - Bioengineering, University of California, San Diego
B.S. - Mechanical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore County 

Dr. Joshua François is an incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering at Boise State University. 
Dr. François received his Ph.D. in Bioengineering from the University of California, San Diego, where he used statistical analysis and three-dimensional (3D) image processing to investigate how the density of 3D environments affects 3D white blood cell migration. As a subsequent postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School, his research focused on the development of novel 3D assays, 3D image analysis techniques, and next-generation sequencing approaches to understand how DNA damage and 3D cell microenvironments affect cell signaling dynamics. 

He has received numerous fellowships and awards, including the Dean’s Postdoctoral Fellowship from Harvard Medical School and the Ford Foundation Dissertation Fellowship. He also has a demonstrated and sustained commitment to inclusion in engineering education and research, as evidenced by his mentorship of numerous undergraduate and graduate engineering students from various backgrounds.
