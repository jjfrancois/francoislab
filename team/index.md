## Team

We are excited to build a collaborative, supportive research group at Boise State University. We welcome motivated undergraduate and graduate students from engineering and biomedical related fields who are interested in joining the lab. If you're interested in working with us, please send Joshua an email along
with your C.V. and a brief statement of research interests to joshua_francois AT hms.harvard.edu.
