# Welcome to the François Lab!

Our lab combines principles from classical mechanics with multi-omics analysis and 3D image 
processing techniques to understand how the properties of cancer cell microenvironments influence the effectiveness of 
DNA-damaging therapies on cancer progression and tumor clearance. We will be opening Fall 2026 in the Department of
Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering at Boise State University!
