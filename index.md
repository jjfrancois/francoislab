# Welcome to the François Lab!

Our lab combines principles from classical mechanics with multi-omics analysis and 3D image 
processing techniques to understand how the properties of cancer cell microenvironments influence the effectiveness of 
DNA-damaging therapies on cancer progression and tumor clearance. We will be opening in Fall 2026 at Boise State University!
